# MusicApp-Kotlin
Created a music application using Kotlin where it will create a visualizer according to the pitch of the voice of the sound/music
The primary goal of this music application is to create a captivating visual representation of sound, allowing users to visually perceive the changes in pitch and intensity. The dynamic visualizer enhances the overall listening experience, making it not only auditory but also visually engaging.
